![Directory Discovery](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-blue.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-yellow.svg)

Welcome to the **Directory Discovery** project! This repository hosts a Python-based Hidden Directory Scanner tailored for ethical hacking and cybersecurity learning. It scans target websites for hidden or unlisted directories using a wordlist and prints the discovered paths. This tool is particularly useful for penetration testers conducting reconnaissance during web application security assessments.

You can download the latest version of Directory Discovery from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Chandana72/Directory_Discovery/releases).

## Features üåü

- **Directory Scanning**: Efficiently scans websites for hidden directories.
- **Custom Wordlists**: Use your own wordlists or the default ones provided.
- **Output Display**: Clearly displays found directories in the console.
- **Ethical Hacking Focus**: Designed for use in ethical hacking and cybersecurity training.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started with Directory Discovery, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandana72/Directory_Discovery.git
   cd Directory_Discovery
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:

   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Chandana72/Directory_Discovery/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions provided there to execute the tool.

## Usage üìñ

To use Directory Discovery, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python directory_discovery.py -u <target_url> -w <wordlist_file>
```

### Parameters:

- `-u`: Specify the target URL.
- `-w`: Provide the path to your wordlist file.

### Example:

```bash
python directory_discovery.py -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt
```

This command will scan the specified website using the provided wordlist and display any hidden directories found.

## How It Works üîç

Directory Discovery employs a straightforward approach to uncover hidden directories:

1. **Input URL**: The user provides a target URL.
2. **Wordlist Usage**: The tool iterates through each entry in the wordlist.
3. **HTTP Requests**: For each entry, it sends an HTTP request to the target URL.
4. **Response Check**: It checks the response status codes to identify valid directories.
5. **Output**: The tool outputs the discovered directories to the console.

This method is effective for identifying paths that may not be easily accessible through standard navigation.
